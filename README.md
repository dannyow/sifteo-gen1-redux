# Sifteo 1st gen software

This repository contains the software and apps for [Sifteo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sifteo_cubes)'s 1st generation product.


## How to use it?

If you aren't wearing a developer hat, simply download and install the prebuild version.
The pkg file contains both the Siftrunner.app and all the apps I've found (hat tip to [Dr. Mike Reddy](http://doctormikereddy.wordpress.com) for his huge help on that)


## Acknowledgments

My special thanks goes out to the whole Sifteo's team for build such incredible and unique system.
