## How to use it?
If you aren't wearing a developer hat, simply [download](https://github.com/dannyow/sifteo-gen1-redux/releases/download/1.1.5-r01/sifteo-gen1-1.1.5-r01.pkg) and install the prebuild version.
The pkg file contains both the Siftrunner.app and all the apps I've found (hat tip to [Dr. Mike Reddy](http://doctormikereddy.wordpress.com) for his huge help on that)
